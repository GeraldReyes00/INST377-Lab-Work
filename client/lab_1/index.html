        <h1>Gerald Reyes Lab 1: Intro to HTML</h1>

        <h2>First, the basics.</h2>
        
        <p>You need the following to build your website.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML and CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Node.js</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>You should list your top 5 albums below.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Igor by Tyler, The Creator</li>
            <li>Blonde by Frank Ocean</li>
            <li>Discovery by Daft Punk</li>
            <li>Random Access Memories by Daft Punk</li>
            <li>Tennessee by RHODAMINE</li>
        </ol>
        
        
        <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>
        
        <p>Sometimes you want to draw attention to something in a line of text.
        
        Sometimes you want to strongly emphasize something in the text.
        
        Sometimes you want to do both.</p>
        
        <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
        
        <p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.
        Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.</p>
        
        <h2>Images</h2> 
        <p>Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.</p>
        
        <img src = 'images/mochi.jpg' alt = 'A mochi ball in a bubble.'/>
        <img src = 'images/mochi.png' alt = 'A mochi ball.'/>
        <img src = 'images/mochi.svg' alt = 'A mochi ball with Bezier handles.'/>
        <img src = 'images/mochi.gif' alt = 'A dancing mochi ball.'/>
        
        <p>Include a hyperlink here to your github repository for class.
        If you want your repo to be private, be sure to invite Prof A as a "collaborator."</p>
