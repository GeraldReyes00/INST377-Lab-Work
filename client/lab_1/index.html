        <h1>Gerald Reyes Lab 1: Intro to HTML</h1>

        <h2>First, the basics.</h2>
        
        <p>You need the following to build your website.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML and CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Node.js</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>You should list your top 3 goals for the class below.</p>
        
            Learn front-end web design
            Learn new programming languages
            Learn how to work with others in a technical space
            Learn popular web dev frameworks
        
        
        <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>
        
        <p>Sometimes you want to draw attention to something in a line of text.
        
        Sometimes you want to strongly emphasize something in the text.
        
        Sometimes you want to do both.</p>
        
        <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
        
        <p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.
        Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.</p>
        
        <h2>Images</h2> 
        <p>Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.</p>
